《旺达幻视》前情提要
Previously on WandaVision...

18
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:02,890
{\an8}《旺达幻视》前情提要

19
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:05,700
你已经进入边界两次了  莫妮卡
You've gone through the boundary twice already, Monica.

20
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:07,640
里面的能量
The energy inside has

21
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,830
在分子层面上两次改写了你的细胞
re-written your cells on a molecular level twice.

22
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,810
我知道旺达的感受  不帮到她我不罢休
I know what Wanda's feeling and I won't stop until I help her.

23
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,450
我想联系西景镇外界
It is my intention to reach those outside of Westview

24
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:21,630
弄清我们现在的状况
and make sense of our situation.

25
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:24,960
帮帮里面的人
The people need help.

26
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,900
妈妈  妈妈
Mom! Mom!

27
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,080
什么  怎么了  比利
What? What is it, Billy?

28
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,250
我听见了爸爸的声音  他出事了
I hear Dad. He's in trouble.

29
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,530
你那死人丈夫又不会死第二回
It's not like your dead husband can die twice.

30
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:40,570
马克西莫夫本就不可能跟我们谈判
Maximoff was never gonna negotiate with us.

31
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:42,220
我们打不过她
We can't outgun her.

32
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:45,940
显然  跟她对立只让事情更糟了
And clearly antagonizing her is only making things worse.

33
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:50,280
如果旺达是问题所在  那解铃还须系铃人
If Wanda is the problem, she has to be our solution.

34
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,040
该死
Oh, fudge!

35
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:49,400
我们都经历过  是吧
Look, we've all been there, right?

36
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,100
被恐惧和愤怒控制
Letting our fear and anger get the best of us,

37
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,360
有意扩展了
intentionally expanding

38
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,140
我们创造了虚构世界的范围
the borders of the false world we created.

39
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,920
让开  让开
Move it! Move it!

40
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,920
妈妈  你很快会下来吗
Mom, are you coming down soon?

41
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:10,540
妈妈  我们的电游在发疯
Mom, our game is freaking out.

42
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,350
她在睡觉吗
Is she asleep?

43
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:25,080
妈妈  没在睡觉
Mommy's not sleeping, honey.

44
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,190
她在休息眼睛
She's just resting her eyes.

45
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,950
妈妈  我的脑袋感觉好怪
Mom, my head feels weird.

46
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,140
好吵
It's, like, really noisy.

47
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,800
我不喜欢
I don't like it.

48
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:38,290
休息眼睛
Resting her eyes.

49
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:41,660
为了惩罚我鲁莽的一晚
As punishment for my reckless evening,

50
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,570
我打算进行隔离形式的家里蹲
I plan on taking a quarantine-style staycation.

51
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,860
一整天
A whole day...

52
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,500
就我自己
just to myself.

53
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,080
这能让我知道错
That'll show me.

54
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,650
我先拿的
I got to it first!

55
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,300
你总是先拿
You always get to it first!

Yeah, I'm not sure what that's about.

62
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,800
可能是只是周一的问题
It's probably just a case of the Mondays.

63
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,140
是吧
Am I right?

我们真幸运  她最终住手了
Lucky for us, she pumped the brakes.

81
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,340
是啊  我可真幸运
Yeah. I feel very lucky.

82
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,750
放送信号怎么样了
What's happening with the broadcast?

83
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,710
毫无动静  信号没了
Dead air. The signal's gone.

84
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,990
务必确保团队什么都不缺
Make sure the team has everything they need.

85
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,380
我们今天发射
We launch today.

86
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,550
是  长官
Yes, sir.

87
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,250
你是新小丑吗
You're the new clown?

88
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,430
至少你已经化好妆了
At least you're already in makeup.

89
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:37,180
你跟逃脱大师的彩排迟到了
You're late for rehearsal with the escape artist.

90
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,240
来吧
Come on.

91
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:44,900
嗯  老实说  我不怎么擅长这活儿
Yeah, I'm not great at this gig, I gotta be honest.

92
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,360
跟我的技能不怎么相称
It doesn't really speak to my skill set.

93
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:48,900
我本想做胡子女
I put in for the bearded lady,

94
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:53,150
但这种雪花石膏的肤色骗不了任何人
but this alabaster complexion wasn't fooling anyone.

95
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,540
有事吗  变态
Can I help you, creeper?

96
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,160
你不记得我们昨晚的事了吗
You don't remember me from last night?

97
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:06,340
我们目光相对过  有种不言的理解
We locked eyes. There was a unspoken understanding.

98
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,980
少他妈来了吧
Um, hard pass.

99
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,540
不  等等  等等
No, wait. Wait up.

100
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,570
你们看到爸爸了吗
Have you seen your dad?

101
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:16,920
没
Um, no.

102
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,680
你要去找他吗
Do you wanna go look for him?

103
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,620
如果他不想待在这里
Well, if he doesn't wanna be here,

104
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,500
我也没办法
there's nothing I can do about it.

105
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,190
{\an8}五日天气预报
周一到周五晴天  周日可能多云

106
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,040
妈妈  昨晚
Hey, Mom, last night,

107
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,100
皮舅舅说什么要再杀爸爸一次
Uncle P said that thing about re-killing Dad?

108
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,740
别相信那男人说的任何话  他不是你们的舅舅
Don't believe anything that man said. He is not your uncle.

109
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,280
那他是谁
Who is he?

110
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:40,850
是这样的  孩子们
Here's the thing, boys.

111
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,660
我是你们妈妈
I'm your mom.

112
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,330
因此
And as such,

113
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:52,560
你们会指望我什么都知道  是吧
you were counting on me to have all the answers, right?

114
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,210
但我不是的
Well, I don't.

115
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:56,910
我...
I have...

116
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:59,170
什么都不知道
no answers.

117
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:01,450
一点都不
Zip. Zero. Zilch.

118
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,150
完全不
Nada. Niente.

119
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:09,420
我开始认为
I'm starting to believe

120
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:12,510
一切都是
that everything is...

121
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,900
无意义的
meaningless.

122
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,490
你们当然可以自己得出结论
You're welcome to draw your own conclusions, of course,

123
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,620
但我现在是这样想的
but that's just where I'm at.

124
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,970
好吧  或许我那是有点黑暗了
Okay. So maybe I went a little too dark there,

125
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,450
但他们会没事的
but they'll be fine.

126
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:30,150
幻视可是振金的  他们继承了坚强的外壳
Vision is made of vibranium. They literally inherited tough skin.

127
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,140
来吧
Come on.

128
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,730
艾格妮丝  进来吧
Hi, Agnes. Come on in.

129
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:41,940
我该起来  但我不想
I'd get up, but I just don't want to.

130
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:47,100
我觉得我出现得非常及时
But I think I got there in the nick of time

131
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,830
不然她可能差点就要自己剪刘海了
'cause she was one split end away from cutting her own bangs.

132
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:54,890
孩子们  给你妈妈一点私人时间吧
Hey, boys, why don't we give your mom some me time?

133
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,000
艾格尼丝  你确定吗
Agnes, are you sure?

134
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,120
绝对确定
Oh, abso-positively.

135
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,030
-来  走吧  -我们一定要走吗  妈妈
- Come on, let's go, guys. - Do we have to, Mom?

136
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:05,210
得有人留在这里照顾你啊
Someone needs to be here to take care of you.

137
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:10,070
孩子们  我没事的  和艾格尼丝去吧
Boys, I'll be fine. Just go with Agnes.

138
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,230
我保证我不会咬人
I promise I won't bite.

139
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,240
我其实以前咬过一个孩子
I actually did bite a kid once.

140
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:20,300
艾格尼丝  你简直是我的救星
Agnes, you are a life-saver.

141
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,670
-有什么我能帮你做的吗  -你知道吗
- Is there anything I can do for you? - You know what?

142
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:27,670
我背上看不见得地方好像是长了一个痦子
I do have a suspicious mole on my back that I just can't see.

143
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:31,460
距离感  我明白
Boundaries. I get it.

144
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,790
不用多说
Say no more.

145
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,450
好了  先生们  赶紧走吧
All right, gentlemen, let's keep it moving.

146
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,810
你们知道吗  要是你们俩能帮我看一眼
You know what? If one of you two could take a quick look,

147
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:40,520
那真是太感激了  就在我的...
I'd appreciate it. It's right here above my...

148
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:05,370
...在球门外展开了完美得进攻
...delivering flawless offensive plays right out of the gate.

149
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,710
最后的进球是精彩...
The final goal scored with a remark...

150
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:14,510
我没事  我没事  我没事
I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.

151
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,100
我没事
I'm fine.

152
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,210
我没事
I'm fine.

153
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,650
{\an8}天剑局

154
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,260
达西穿过了最后一道防火墙
Darcy made it through that last firewall, all right.

155
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,510
她有什么发现
Oh, what'd she find?

156
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:34,030
研发报告  都是同一个项目的
R and D reports. All on the same project.

157
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:34,190
{\an8}达西·刘易斯
你好  吉米
我突破了防火墙  有很多关于同一个项目的研究报告  代号幻光
我发现了幻视身体的构造图  海沃德没有解构幻视  他是想要利用天剑局的资源让他复活  他尝试了很多次  但是都没有用  直到旺达偷走了幻视的尸体  这是他给幻视办公室发的假公报
达西

158
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,080
代号  幻光
Code name, Cataract.

159
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,300
海沃德没有解构幻视
Hayward wasn't decommissioning Vision.

160
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,920
他想要复活幻视  但是一直没有成功  直到...
He was trying to bring him back online. Nothing worked until...

161
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,150
旺达偷走了幻视的尸体
Wanda stole Vision's body.

162
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:51,080
所以他如此执着于在六边域里找到幻视
That's why he was so focused on tracking Vision inside the Hex.

163
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,590
海沃德要拿回他的有意识武器
Hayward wants his sentient weapon back.

164
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,440
这件事得找人告诉旺达
Someone has to tell Wanda.

165
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,400
看  他们在那里
Look. There they are.

166
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,670
-古德纳少校  -兰博上尉
- Major Goodner. - Captain Rambeau.

167
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,140
这是吴探员
This is Agent Woo.

168
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:27,580
认识你很高兴
Nice to meet you.

169
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,440
非常感谢你的到来
Thank you so much for coming.

170
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:31,740
我的母亲会很感谢你的忠心
My mother would appreciate your loyalty.

171
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:34,120
我们不仅只听命于她  上尉
She's not the only one we're loyal to, Captain.

172
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,650
让我带你去看看我们带来了什么
Let me show you what we brought you.

173
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,750
符合你的期待规模吗
Did we get your specs right?

174
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,960
太完美了
She's perfect.

175
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:08,410
{\an8}天剑局

176
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:22,900
喂  不好意思  你之前想帮我的
Hello? Excuse me. Uh, you tried to help me.

177
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,690
那可不一定  我是出了名的自私自利
Doubtful. I'm notoriously self-involved.

178
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:27,450
不不不  拜托  听我说
No, no, no. Please. Just hear me out.

179
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:30,600
好吧  我相信你是隶属于
All right. I believe that you were part of a team

180
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,460
一个专门监管超自然现象的团队  现在...
monitoring a supernatural anomaly. And now...

181
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,790
你也进来了
Well, you're in it.

182
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:40,180
好吧  我愿意和你约会  但我要点龙虾
Fine. I'll go out with you, but I'm ordering the lobster.

183
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,310
不  看  那个演哑剧的  他的盘子太重了
Oh, no. Look, that mime... His tray is getting too heavy.

184
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:47,080
你的腰不好
Oh, your bad back!

185
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,020
哇哦  好吧
Whoa! Okay. Ooh.

186
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,210
-醒了吗  -嗯
- Awake? - Ooh, uh, yeah.

187
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,280
没事吧
All right?

188
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:58,210
你好啊  我自己
Oh, hello, self.

189
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,840
我内心是有点偷偷想客串这部戏
You know, part of me secretly wanted a guest spot on the show,

190
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:04,030
但说真的  那糟糕透了
but seriously, that sucked.

191
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:06,910
你叫什么名字  你的真名
Look, uh, what is your name? Your real name?

192
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,360
达西·刘易斯
Darcy Lewis.

193
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,320
达西·刘易斯博士
Dr. Darcy Lewis.

194
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,200
我截获了一封关于你的研究的信
I intercepted a communication regarding your work.

195
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,300
狮子刚下场  该你们上了
Hey, the lions just got off stage. You're up.

196
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,590
刘易斯博士  我有好多问题
Dr. Lewis, I have questions.

197
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:18,000
我有答案
I have answers.

198
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:20,090
我们要不要开这车上路
Ooh, should we take this convo on the road?

199
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,660
-太好了  -该你俩上场了
- Excellent. - You two are up.

200
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:26,010
不行  真抱歉  博士和我早就约好了
No, I'm so sorry. Doctor and I have a prior engagement.

201
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:28,160
她哪也不许去
She's not goin' anywhere.

202
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,800
不  我的鼻子
Oh, no! My nose!

203
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,470
-抱歉  -快走
- Sorry. - Come on.

204
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:36,690
-借过  -你俩要去哪
- Oh. Excuse me. - Where do you think you're going?

205
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,120
给我回来
Get back here!

206
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,840
去你家吗
To your house, I assume?

207
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:44,730
刘易斯博士  我想问  我的孩子们安全吗
Dr. Lewis, my questions, are my children safe?

208
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:45,880
我不知道
That I don't know.

209
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,190
那个冒牌货皮特是谁
Who is that imposter, Pietro?

210
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,480
问倒我了
Beats me.

211
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,810
-我们走吧  -太好了
- Let's roll. - Great.

212
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,500
-给我出来  -抱歉  听不清你说什么
- Get out of there. - Sorry. Can't hear you.

213
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,440
-什么  -快开车啊
- What? - Drive!

214
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:02,920
实在对不起  经纪人把我们的时间约重了
I'm so sorry. We were double-booked by the agents.

215
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:04,490
你们必须上场
You got to be on stage.

216
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,230
-踩油门啊  达西  -你们在干什么
- Step on it, Darcy! - What are you doing?

217
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:06,920
我听不见你说什么
No, I can't hear you.

218
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:10,320
你们给我回来  我需要你们
You get back here! I need you!

219
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,900
我不明白这是怎么回事
I don't understand what's happening.

220
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,350
为什么...
Why it's...

221
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,120
为什么一切都崩溃了  为什么...
Why it's all falling apart and why...

222
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,180
我没办法解决
I can't fix it.

223
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:55,450
是不是因为你罪有应得
Do you think maybe this is what you deserve?

224
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,540
什么
What?

225
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:03,050
你不该说话的
You're not supposed to talk.

226
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,480
感觉抑郁
Feeling depressed?

227
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:13,110
觉得世界没了自己也能继续
Like the world goes on without you?

228
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:16,760
只想独处吗
Do you just want to be left alone?

229
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:20,240
向您的医生咨询下"链结"
Ask your doctor about Nexus.

230
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,300
{\an8}链结

231
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:21,880
一种独特的抗抑郁药物
A unique anti-depressant

232
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:24,990
能将您锚定回现实中
that works to anchor you back to your reality.

233
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,170
{\an8}链结

234
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,740
或者您选择的现实
Or the reality of your choice.

235
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:38,320
{\an8}链结

236
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,680
副作用包括感觉到自己的感受
Side effects include feeling your feelings,

237
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,810
面对真相  抓住命运
confronting your truth, seizing your destiny,

238
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:34,570
而且很可能导致抑郁加深
and possibly, more depression.

239
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:35,780
除非医生允许您继续生活
You should not take Nexus

240
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:39,010
否则请勿使用"链结"
unless your doctor has cleared you to move on with your life.

241
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,320
{\an8}链结

242
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:46,800
{\an8}链结

243
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:43,840
"链结"  因为世界并不是围着您转的
Nexus, because the world doesn't revolve around you.

244
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:46,040
也可能是呢
Or does it?

245
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,310
萨米
Hey, Sammy.

246
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:52,150
有人渴了吗
Okay, who's thirsty?

247
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:53,370
这有饮料
Some bevs.

248
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,970
你在想什么呢
Penny for your thoughts.

249
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:04,520
我喜欢这里
I like it here.

250
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,000
那很好啊
Oh, good.

251
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:11,700
是因为挠挠先生会耐心听你倾诉吗
Is it because Señor Scratchy is such a good listener?

252
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,750
不是
No.

253
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,010
是因为这里很安静
It's because it's quiet.

254
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,200
你很安静  艾格尼丝
You're quiet, Agnes.

255
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,490
你的内心
On the inside.

256
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,980
你觉得我们妈妈没事吗
Do you think our mom is okay?

257
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,810
当然没事了
Oh, for sure!

258
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:43,860
你们不用担心你们妈妈
Oh, you don't have to worry about your mom.

259
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:48,200
她无所不能  是超人妈妈
Your mom can do anything. She's supermom.

260
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,780
拉夫说我喜欢粉饰太平
Ralph says I sugarcoat things.

261
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:56,120
但你试试告诉一个十岁孩子
But you try telling a 10-year-old

262
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,040
他妈妈疯逼了
that his mother is cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.

263
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:02,710
最后检查
Final checks.

264
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,020
一切准备就绪  上尉
We're all set, Captain.

265
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,660
谢谢
Thank you.

266
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,630
达西不在这里  没法给你认可
Darcy's not here to give her stamp of approval.

267
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,150
我知道
I know.

268
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:25,080
她在里面  我会进去救她出来
She's in there and I'm gonna go get her out.

269
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,930
这是我们的最后一搏  吉米
It's our last shot, Jimmy.

270
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:35,970
祝成功  上尉
Godspeed, Captain.

271
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,410
你对这玩意有多大信心
How much faith you have in this thing?

272
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,020
这是我们防御力最强的太空车
It's our most heavily-armored space rover.

273
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,390
她能直接开进去  毫发不伤
She's gonna sail right through. Unharmed.

274
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,360
检查上尉的通讯设备
Capcom, check.

275
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:14,400
没问题
Good, check.

276
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:16,510
听你的指令  上尉
On your order, Captain.

277
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:19,740
出发
Moving out.

278
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:39,960
接触倒计时  五  四  三
Contact in five, four, three...

279
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:42,850
二  一
two, one.

280
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,600
不是说能直接开进去吗
What happened to sailing right through?

281
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,120
密度正和她匹配
The density is matching her.

282
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:57,330
我快成功了  屏障会被冲破
I'm close. It's gonna give!

283
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,810
结构完整性在降低
The structural integrity is failing.

284
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:15,830
正在瓦解
It's disintegrating.

285
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,380
不  是正在重写
No, it's being rewritten.

286
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,900
莫妮卡  快下车
Monica, get out of there!

287
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,540
听到吗  莫妮卡
Do you copy, Monica?

288
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,170
莫妮卡  快下车
Monica! Get out of there!

289
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:29,710
莫妮卡
Monica!

290
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,560
快派救伤直升机
Get a medevac, now!

291
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:46,070
当心
Watch out!

292
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,390
不  不要
No. No.

293
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:02,860
我能穿过去
I can get through.

294
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,100
莫妮卡  不
Monica! No!

295
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:22,600
不  我不能  我不能丢下莫妮卡
No, I can't. I can't leave Monica.

296
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,060
妈妈  没事
Mommy, it's okay.

297
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,580
我可以去外婆外公家住
I can stay with Grandma and Pop-Pop.

298
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,960
我不能去  宝贝  太危险了
There's no way I'm going, baby. It's too dangerous.

299
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,540
妈妈  或许我可以飞上天  和你中途相会
Mom, maybe I could fly up and meet you halfway?

300
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:38,290
那你得学会像卡罗尔阿姨那样发光
Only if you learn to glow like your Aunt Carol.

301
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,480
你是我认识的最强大的人
And you were the most powerful person I knew.

302
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,690
你妈妈死了  亲爱的
Your mom, she died, honey.

303
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:45,050
她激励了我们
She was truly an inspiration.

304
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,940
-很遗憾  -不
- Sorry. - No!

305
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,390
你妈妈很幸运
Your mom's lucky.

306
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:52,370
天上发孩子时  给了她最坚强的一个
When they were handing out kids, they gave her the toughest one.

307
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,300
所以旺达杀了我吗
So, Wanda killed me?

308
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:49,730
是的  但没那么简单  是你叫她这么做的
Yes, but it's not that simple. You asked her to do it.

309
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,380
我为什么要那么做
Why would I have done that?

310
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:53,610
拯救全宇宙
To save the universe.

311
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,180
一半的宇宙
Well, half of it.

312
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,110
有效果吗
Did it work?

313
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:58,810
有啊
It did.

314
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:03,590
但是反派逆转了时间  亲自杀了你
Until the bad guy rewound time and killed you himself.

315
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,290
虽然中间还有其他小插曲
There are a few extra steps,

316
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:06,680
但是长话短说
but to set up the context...

317
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,420
我回到过去  又死了一次
I came back and died again.

318
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,160
还让她亲眼看着你死去
And she had to watch.

319
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,770
不是吧  又是红灯
Oh, man, another red light?

320
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,770
在这么偏僻的地方设置红绿灯没必要吧
It's kinda overkill out in the sticks here,

321
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:19,440
你觉得呢
don't you think?

322
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:21,620
是啊
Yes.

323
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:29,990
我觉得  是旺达创造了这些障碍
I believe... I think that Wanda is creating

324
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:34,200
不让我回家
these impediments to stop me returning home.

325
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:38,240
再说  西景也没下过雨吧
Also, it never rains in Westview, right?

326
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,670
我很不开心
I'm not amused.

327
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:57,890
{\an8}前方施工

328
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:01,650
行吧  你们慢慢干吧
Yeah, great. Just take your time, fellas.

329
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,010
如果我理解正确的话
So if I understand correctly,

330
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:09,480
我最初是一个名叫贾维斯的人工智能
my original code dates back to an AI called Jarvis?

331
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:12,410
但是我的身体
But my corporeal form

332
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:17,070
是奥创企图灭绝人类计划的产物
was born of Ultron's plan for global genocide?

333
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:18,840
完全正确
Correct-o.

334
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,350
那我现在是什么
What am I now?

335
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,510
老实说  我是研究理工科的
Honestly, I'm a STEM type of lady,

336
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:30,370
所以我觉得她打开了你脑袋里的开关
so I thought she just flipped a switch on your head

337
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:31,460
让你起死回生
and brought you back to life,

338
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:35,890
但是我不明白你为什么不能离开六边域
but what I don't get is why you can't leave the Hex.

339
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,360
但是我知道的是
What I do know is I've

340
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:46,430
上周我一直在看《旺达幻视》
been watching WandaVision for the past week.

341
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:48,940
你们俩之间的爱意是真的
And the love you two have is real.

342
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,040
你们是天生一对
You belong together.

343
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:15,570
旺达  旺达
Wanda? Wanda!

344
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:16,500
你在做什么
What are you doing?

345
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,960
-旺达  -你是怎么进来的
- Wanda... - How did you get in here?

346
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,380
听我说  一切都是为了幻视
Listen to me. This whole thing is about Vision.

347
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:23,030
-离开我家  -海沃德想让他...
- Get out of my house. - Hayward was trying to bring him...

348
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:26,530
别跟我说这些  我根本不想听
Don't talk to me about that. I don't wanna hear about it.

349
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:30,990
无人机  导弹  皮特
The drones, the missiles. Pietro?

350
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,540
不  等等  皮特不是我们安排的
No, wait, Pietro, no, no, no, that wasn't us.

351
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:35,410
你们只会说谎
All you do is lie!

352
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:47,650
我说过的只有你让我说的谎言
The only lies I've told are the ones you put in my mouth.

353
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:50,570
注意你的言辞
Careful what you say to me.

354
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,770
来啊
Do it, then.

355
00:23:58,090 --> 00:23:58,980
把我扔出去
Take me out.

356
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,990
你看  这就是你和海沃德不一样的地方
See, see? That's where you and Hayward differ.

357
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,840
他为了达到目的
He's gonna burn Westview to the ground

358
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,140
不惜把西景镇烧成灰烬
just to get what he wants.

359
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:11,310
不要让他把你变成凶手
Don't let him make you the villain.

360
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,620
或许我就是凶手
Maybe I already am.

361
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:24,240
我不怕你  旺达
I'm not afraid of you, Wanda.

362
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:28,580
我也失去了我最亲近的人
I lost the person closest to me, too.

363
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:31,370
我可以想象的最糟糕的事情
The worst thing I can think of

364
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:32,890
已经发生了
has already happened to me

365
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,590
我无力改变  无法挽回
and I can't change it. I can't undo it.

366
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:38,330
我不能再隐瞒这种痛苦了
I can't control this pain anymore.

367
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:42,770
我也不想隐瞒了  因为这就是我的真相
And I don't think I want to, because it's my truth.

368
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:47,830
旺达  你要
Wanda, you have to...

369
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,960
女士  你好像有点得寸进尺了
Young lady, I think you overstayed your welcome.

370
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,630
可怜的旺达已经经历够多了
Poor Wanda's been through enough.

371
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:58,350
这跟你没关系  旺达
This doesn't concern you. Wanda...

372
00:24:58,730 --> 00:24:59,690
离开吧
Run along, dear.

373
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:05,230
-旺达  你必须解开这里  -绝不
- Wanda, you have to take it down. - No.

374
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:09,280
-别逼我伤害你  -好了
- Don't make me hurt you. - All right.

375
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,390
好了  咱们收工吧
Okay, let's wrap it up.

376
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,510
终于结束了
Yes, finally.

377
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,530
{\an8}停

378
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,750
拜托了
Oh, come on!

379
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,100
孩子们  快跟上
Come on, kids.

380
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:41,120
孩子们  然后呢  再来一群小狗吗
Kids? What's next, puppies?

381
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,450
我完全想象不到
I had no idea how much

382
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:44,690
旺达来西景之前到底忍受了多少痛苦
Wanda had endured before coming to Westview,

383
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:46,890
我想应该说我们都忍受了很多
how much we both had, I guess.

384
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,490
虽然我不记得了
Though I can't remember it.

385
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:52,410
对我来说  就像发生在别人身上的事一样
For me, it feels like it happened to someone else, you know?

386
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:53,690
但是对她来说
But for her...

387
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,160
这就是几周前的事
It's mere weeks ago.

388
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:04,860
我在干什么呢  坐着和你谈心  我明明应该
What am I doing here, sitting, talking to you when I should...

389
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:09,110
这真是  这太可笑了  我得去找我妻子了
This is... This is absurd. I need to get to my wife.

390
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:18,760
那我就去那里和你汇合是吧
So I'll just meet you there, then?

391
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,270
过来
Oh, here.

392
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,990
亲爱的  要不要喝杯茶
Would you like a cup of tea, hon?

393
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:26,670
-好的  谢谢你  艾格尼丝  -没问题
- Sure. Thank you, Agnes. - Okay.

394
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:30,420
坐吧  我去泡茶  马上回来
Sit down. Be right back with that.

395
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:39,470
跳呀  跳呀  跳呀
Jump! Jump! Jump!

396
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,620
跳起来  跳呀  跳呀  跳呀
Jumpy, jump, jump, jump, jump

397
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:45,190
跳起来  跳呀  跳呀  跳呀
Jumpy, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump

398
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:47,360
跳起来  跳呀  跳呀  跳呀
Jumpy, jump, jump, jump, jump

399
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:50,200
跳起来  跳呀  跳呀  跳呀
Jumpy, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump

400
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,310
我的孩子们在哪儿
Where are the twins?

401
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:09,710
他们可能就在地下室里玩呢
Oh, they're probably just playing in the basement.

402
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:26,660
孩子们
Boys?

403
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:53,600
汤米
Tommy?

404

比利
Billy?

405
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,820
旺达呀旺达
Wanda, Wanda.

406
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:45,410
你不会以为镇上就你一个人会法术吧
You didn't think you were the only magical girl in town, did you?

407
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:52,720
我叫阿加莎·哈克尼斯
The name's Agatha Harkness.

408
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,540
